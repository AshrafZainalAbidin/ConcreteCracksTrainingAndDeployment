# Deep Learning Computer Vision With Transfer Learning
Defects in concrete can occur during and even after construction. Cracks in concrete poses safety concerns and may cost financially and human lives if neglected. Thus it is important to inspect building concrete for defects.

In this project, we will be training a model to identify cracks in concrete from images using Tensorflow Keras.
